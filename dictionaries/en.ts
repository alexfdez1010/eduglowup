It has always been said that one shouldn’t try to reinvent the wheel, but I believe that if it weren’t for someone before us who made the effort to think outside the box, many advancements would never have been achieved. Therefore, education should not be about memorizing abstract words and numbers, but rather a tool that drives creativity beyond what is imagined.',

    story: `
It all began when Alejandro, a 10th-grade student, faced a common problem: he spent hours studying, but the results just didn’t show. Language and English were his biggest struggles. With Spanish as his native tongue, the time spent on these subjects didn’t seem to make a difference. Frustrated, he asked himself a crucial question: “How can I improve the way I study?”

Determined to find something that worked, he began researching new techniques. He experimented with active recall and active learning, methods that completely transformed his study habits. Thanks to his persistence, the results started to show. His average grade shot up to 9.5 out of 10. But Alejandro didn’t stop there; throughout high school, he kept refining these techniques and eventually graduated with a perfect 10. He had found an effective way to study, and this experience became his drive to go further.

In college, Alejandro decided to study Software Engineering and set an even bigger challenge for himself: to finish his degree in just 3.5 years. The workload was intense, and the final semester turned into a real ordeal. He was juggling six subjects, his final project, and a part-time job. Right in the middle of this chaos, a tool appeared that would change everything: ChatGPT.

Discovering ChatGPT was a turning point. Alejandro began using it to generate practical exercises, a task that had previously taken up hours of his time. This change allowed him to focus on what really mattered. With the help of artificial intelligence, he managed to complete his degree within the time he had set for himself. It was then that he realized the potential of technology to transform how we study.

With this idea in mind, he developed the first version of what would later become EduGlowUp. He created a website that generated multiple-choice exams using ChatGPT. Without realizing it, he had built an MVP (Minimum Viable Product). He shared his project on GitHub, the social network for programmers, hoping that others could benefit from his creation.

What happened next was unexpected. Many people started using the app, and to his surprise, he even received a donation. That was when Alejandro realized the potential of what he had in his hands. This was no longer just a tool to improve his own study habits; it could be something much bigger.

Determined to pursue this idea, he teamed up with Óscar, a friend and web development expert. However, starting a business was no easy feat. They faced challenges like a lack of business experience and the need to learn on the fly. That’s when they decided to join El Círculo, an entrepreneurship program, where they learned to navigate the world of startups.

The journey was full of lessons. They learned the importance of financial viability, the need for solid legal backing, and most importantly, how to validate their product using the Lean Startup method. After months of hard work, they launched their first MVP. Even though they knew that finding Product Market Fit would be a long road, they were ready to face it.

As EduGlowUp continued to grow, they realized they needed to improve how they presented themselves to the world. Marketing was becoming crucial, and following the principle of asking for help when needed, they decided to bring in Carlos, another friend, to lead the marketing strategy. With his addition, the team was ready to continue driving EduGlowUp’s mission: to help students study in the most productive and effective way possible.
