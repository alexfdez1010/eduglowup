"Cookies" are small data files that the internet server sends to the browser, which are then returned with each new access. These files are stored on your computer, mobile, or tablet and allow the system to remember features or browsing preferences from previous sessions, such as the website language or your username and password.

## Types of Cookies

Below, we present a classification to make things clearer, including their purpose:

a) According to the entity that manages them. Depending on who manages the equipment or domain from where the cookies are sent and processes the data obtained, we can distinguish:

- Third-party cookies: These are sent to the user’s terminal from a device or domain not managed by EduGlowUp, but by another entity that processes the data obtained through the cookies. Since these third parties proceed with their implementation, their blocking and uninstallation are governed by their specific conditions and mechanisms.

- Session cookies: These are designed to collect and store data while the user accesses a webpage. These cookies are stored on your device until the user’s browsing session ends.

c) According to their purpose:

- Technical cookies: These allow the user to browse through the webpage or platform and use different options or services, such as controlling data traffic and communication, identifying the session, accessing restricted access areas, using security elements during browsing, storing content for video or audio dissemination, or sharing content through social networks like Instagram, X, TikTok, or YouTube. These include session and persistent cookies.
- Personalization cookies: These allow the user to access the service with some predefined features based on a series of criteria in the user's terminal, such as the type of browser used to access the service, the regional configuration from where the service is accessed, etc.
